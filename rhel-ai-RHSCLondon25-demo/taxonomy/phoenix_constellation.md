# Phoenix (constellation)

**Phoenix** is a minor constellation in the southern sky. Named after the mythical phoenix,
it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 *Uranometria*. The
French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted the brighter stars and gave
their Bayer designations in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly −39 degrees to −57
degrees declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension. The constellations Phoenix,
Grus , Pavo and Tucana, are known as the Southern Birds.

The brightest star, Alpha Phoenicis, is named Ankaa, an Arabic word meaning 'the Phoenix'.
It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is Beta Phoenicis, actually a
binary system composed of two yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. Nu Phoenicis
has a dust disk, while the constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently
discovered galaxy clusters El Gordo and the Phoenix Cluster—located 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years
away respectively, two of the largest objects in the visible universe. Phoenix is the radiant of
two annual meteor showers: the Phoenicids in December, and the July Phoenicids.

## History

Phoenix was the largest of the 12 constellations established by Petrus Plancius from the observations
of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial
globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first
depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's*Uranometria* of 1603. De Houtman
included it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name *Den voghel Fenicx*,
"The Bird Phoenix", symbolizing the phoenix of classical mythology. One name of the brightest star Alpha
Phoenicis—Ankaa—is derived from the Arabic: العنقاء, romanized: al-‘anqā’, lit. 'the phoenix', and was
coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation.

Celestial historian Richard Allen noted that unlike the other constellations introduced by Plancius and La
Caille, Phoenix has actual precedent in ancient astronomy, as the Arabs saw this formation as representing
young ostriches, *Al Ri'āl*, or as a griffin or eagle. In addition, the same group of stars was sometimes
imagined by the Arabs as a boat, *Al Zaurak*, on the nearby river Eridanus. He observed,
"the introduction of a Phoenix into modern astronomy was, in a measure, by adoption rather than by invention."

The Chinese incorporated Phoenix's brightest star, Ankaa (Alpha Phoenicis), and stars from the adjacent
constellation Sculptor to depict *Bakui*, a net for catching birds. Phoenix and the neighboring constellation
of Grus together were seen by Julius Schiller as portraying Aaron the High Priest. These two constellations,
along with nearby Pavo and Tucana, are called the Southern Birds.

## Characteristics

Phoenix is a small constellation bordered by Fornax and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the
south, touching on the corner of Hydrus to the south, and Eridanus to the east and southeast. The bright star
Achernar is nearby. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical
Union in 1922, is "Phe". The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in
1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension
coordinates of these borders lie between 23<sup>h</sup> 26.5<sup>m</sup> and 02<sup>h</sup> 25.0<sup>m</sup>, while
the declination coordinates are between −39.31° and −57.84°. This means it remains below the horizon to anyone
living north of the 40th parallel  in the Northern Hemisphere, and remains low in the sky for anyone living north
of the equator. It is most visible from locations such as Australia and South Africa during late Southern Hemisphere spring.
Most of the constellation lies within, and can be located by, forming a triangle of the bright stars Achernar,
Fomalhaut and Beta Ceti—Ankaa lies roughly in the centre of this.
